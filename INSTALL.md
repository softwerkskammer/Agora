# System requirements and Installation

## Node.js

It is a node.js project. Therefore you need node.js installed. Get it from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

You need a current 6.x version to run the software.

Your node.js ships npm in a suitable version.

## Additional Software

Some modules are compiled during the installation. Therefore some additional software must be installed.

### Python & C++

In former versions of this project it was neccessary to have Python and a C++ compiler installed on your local dev machine.
This was because we indirectly used modules that itself were based on native code inside that needed to be compiled. For these native 
modules nodejs uses `node-gyp`. Please have a look at their github project for further information. 
https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp

We have removed all dependencies that required this. Please inform us via a github issue if you run into problems here.

The sympton will be recognizable by errors during an `npm install` that contains failing `node-gyp` jobs.

### Git

* Git must be in the system path.

### MongoDB

* Install MongoDB (Version 2.4 or greater) [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

### ImageMagick

The ImageMagick command line tools are used to convert images. If you're seeing
`Uncaught Error: spawn convert ENOENT` when running the integration tests, make
sure that it is installed an available in your $PATH.

### Grunt-CLI

We propose to install grunt-cli globally via the -g option of npm. To find out more about this option, see [https://npmjs.org/doc/global.html](https://npmjs.org/doc/global.html).:

* (Optional) To define the installation location of global npm packages on Unix-like Systems create a file called `.npmrc` with the following contents in your Home directory:

        prefix=GLOBALPATH
        umask=077

* Anywhere, invoke `npm install -g grunt-cli` or `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have sufficient user privileges. You can check the installation with `which grunt`. If a location is returned everything is fine.
* (Optional) If the directory `GLOBALPATH/bin` is not in your path (you can check with `echo $PATH`), you need to add it to the path: In your Home directory, create or edit the file `.profile` and add the following line:

        export PATH=GLOBALPATH/bin/:$PATH

### Shell for `npm install`

* You need a shell (a.k.a. command line window) that is able to access the stuff you just installed.

## Preparations for use

* Check out this project into some folder (let's call it *REPO* from now on)
* Open a shell as described above and go to *REPO*
* Run `npm install`

* If python 3 is the default version, the command line for `npm install` must be adapted to the right python version (2.7)

            npm install --python=/usr/bin/python2

* Start mongodb. If you only plan to use it for development, the default settings are ok. The app as well as the tests use these defaults if you did not change the configuration.
* (Optional) Instructions for authenticated use are [here](lib/persistence/README.md)

### The built-in wiki

To set up the built-in wiki follow [these instructions](softwerkskammer/lib/wiki/README.md)

### Configuring the server

Configuration for Softwerkskammer and SoCraTes:

* Copy `config/example-winston-config.json` to `config/winston-config.json`, remove the comment in the first line, and adapt the paths if you like.

### Running the server

* Open a shell in *REPO*
* If your installation is fresh, perform the db initialization script:
   * Run `node softwerkskammer/initialDBSetup`
* If your installation is fresh or you changed anything:
   * Run `npm test` (this creates the CSS files and other static contents and performs eslint checking)

Now you can decide which app you want to start:

* Start softwerkskammer
    * `node start-softwerkskammer` - will start the server
    * Now go to your local machine, open a browser and use `http://localhost:17124`

* Start socrates
    * `./build-socrates.sh` in order to build some css, js etc.
    * `node start-socrates`- will start the server
    * Now go to your local machine, open a browser and use `http://localhost:17224`

* The ports `17124` and `17224` are the default and can be changed via the command line option `--port` or via the environment option 'port' to any desired value
* If your installation is fresh, you should create an account for yourself by registering.
  * The default setup assumes you are running on localhost for authentication. If you are using a different hostname, you have to edit the configuration file `config/example-server-config.json`. Follow the instructions in there.

### Full Access to the Applications

Not all features can be accessed without login. Some can only be accessed when you are superuser.

Access for Softwerkskammer and SoCraTes:

* Log in to the application (Softwerkskammer or SoCraTes or both). Be aware that Google and Github cannot be used out of the box. Therefore, you should use an OpenID provider such as Stack Exchange, XLogon (https://my.xlogon.net/)
  or you can choose one from this list: http://openid.net/get-an-openid/

* To access certain admin features, you may want to become superuser. This step will make you superuser of both applications at once.
  In order to do this, open `mongo swk`, display all member information via `db.memberstore.find().pretty()` and search for your entry. Select the string after `id`, create a copy of `config/example-authentication-config.json`, 
  name it `authentication-config.json`, and add your id to the `superuser` array.

Access for SoCraTes:

* Copy the `config/example-socrates-server-config.json` and name it `config/socrates-server-config.json` (don't forget to remove the comment).
* Create a SoCraTes by invoking `/activities/new`. Make sure that the date matches the year that is hardcoded in `socrates/lib/activities/socratesConstants.js` in the variable `currentYear`.

### Windows Systems

Currently there are issues when running the tests:
* most tests that verify pathnames will fail because of the "\" used by Windows as a separator
* furthermore all tests that need imagemagick will fail as there is no binary version for Windows available
