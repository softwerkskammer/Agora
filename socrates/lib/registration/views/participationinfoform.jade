      h3 Payment and Invoice
      p.
        You will pay for the hotel and the hotel will issue an invoice on departure. During registration you can enter 
        an alternate address for the invoice if the address is not your residential address.
      h4 Deposit
      p.
        We require you to pay a (non-refundable) deposit of 100 &euro; as soon as you finish your registration. This will
        also validate your registration. You will not receive an invoice for the deposit, so you propably will have to pay this 
        from your private money.
      p However, we will return your deposit to you in cash during your arrival at the conference.
      p You have two alternatives to pay the deposit:
      ul
        li Via bank transfer to a German bank account
        li Via credit card (+3,30 &euro; non-refundable fee, no invoice)
      p.
        If you cannot participate in the event, you can provide another participant to substitute you &ndash; your deposit can
        then be counted towards the replacing participant. Please contact us in this case.
